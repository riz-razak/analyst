# Strategic Foundation: analyst.rizrazak.com
## Analytical Framework for Liberation Journalism in Sri Lanka

*This document is the philosophical, sociological, and strategic basis for everything the platform does — from content strategy to analytics design to cooperative ventures. It is not a marketing plan. It is an operating theory.*

---

## I. PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION

### The Core Position

This platform operates from an anarchist socialist framework — not as ideology, but as method. The goal is not to seize the state or win elections. It is to build **dual power**: parallel structures that make the old extractive system irrelevant, while using investigative journalism to strip legitimacy from the existing one.

This is **prefigurative politics** — the means embody the ends. A cooperative ride-hailing platform isn't just cheaper rides. It is a lived demonstration that people can organise horizontally, share value equitably, and govern themselves. The dossiers aren't just exposés. They are tools for collective sense-making — helping people see the system as a *system*, not as isolated scandals.

### Key Intellectual Threads

**Kropotkin — Mutual Aid.** Human cooperation, not competition, is the basis of survival and progress. Sri Lanka's village-level mutual aid traditions (shramadana, death donation societies, rotating credit) are anarchist structures that predate capitalism. The task is not to invent something new but to reconnect people with what colonialism and neo-capitalism displaced.

**Fanon — The Psychopolitics of Liberation.** Colonialism doesn't just extract resources — it colonises the mind. Sri Lankans internalised British hierarchies, then reproduced them through Sinhala-Buddhist nationalism, caste, English-language elitism, and deference to political "big men." Liberation requires psychological decolonisation *alongside* material change. Content must do both: show the system's mechanics (rational) and break the spell of inevitability (emotional/cultural).

**Freire — Pedagogy of the Oppressed.** Education is either domesticating or liberating. Sri Lanka's tuition class industry is domesticating — it trains compliance and rote memorisation in service of an extractive exam system. The platform's education venture must be Freirean: dialogical, critical, enabling people to read their own reality. The dossiers model this — they teach people to analyse, not just consume.

**Graeber — Debt and Bullshit.** Sri Lanka's 2022 collapse was a debt crisis manufactured by extractive lending (China, ISBs, IMF structural adjustment). Graeber's analysis of debt as a tool of social control is directly applicable. The platform must connect personal debt (microfinance traps, leasing) to sovereign debt (IMF conditionality) to help people see the same extraction at different scales.

**Bookchin — Social Ecology and Municipalism.** The domination of nature and the domination of people have the same root. Sri Lanka's environmental crises (sand mining, Uma Oya, Wilpattu encroachment) are not separate from political corruption — they are the same system. Bookchin's municipalism (building power at the local/community level rather than capturing the national state) maps well onto Sri Lanka's Pradeshiya Sabha structure — local councils that could be captured for democratic experimentation.

**Ambedkar — Caste Abolition.** Sri Lanka officially denies caste but it operates powerfully: in marriage, in professions (toddy-tapping castes, fishing castes, washerman castes), in political patronage networks, in who gets to be "respectable." The platform must name this without reproducing Sinhala-Buddhist nationalist framing that denies caste while enforcing it.

**E.F. Schumacher — "Small is Beautiful."** Against the logic of scale that says PickMe must have venture capital and Uber must dominate. Cooperative structures can be efficient at human scale. The menstrual pad cooperative doesn't need to be a billion-dollar company. It needs to serve its community, pay its workers fairly, and demonstrate that another way is possible.

## II. SRI LANKAN CONTEXT: THE SYSTEM AS IT IS

### Political Economy

Sri Lanka's economy is an **extractive relay**. Each era hands the extraction mechanism to the next:

**Colonial era (1505–1948):** Portuguese → Dutch → British. Plantation economy. Extracted cinnamon, then coffee, then tea and rubber. Created an English-speaking Sinhalese and Tamil elite class to administer extraction. Destroyed self-sufficient village economies and integrated the island into global commodity markets on dependent terms.

**Post-independence (1948–1977):** Welfare state built on plantation revenue. Free education and healthcare (genuine achievements). But the elite class remained — English-educated, Colombo-centred, politically connected. Sinhala-only Act (1956) weaponised language as ethnic marker rather than liberating the Sinhala-educated majority.

**Open economy (1977–present):** Structural adjustment. Garment zones. Free trade zones where young women from rural areas work for subsistence wages making clothes for Western brands. Remittance economy — exporting domestic workers to the Middle East. Tourism enclave economy. Each sector extracts from the most vulnerable.

**Rajapaksa era (2005–2022):** Chinese-funded infrastructure debt. Hambantota port, Mattala airport, Lotus Tower — vanity projects serving elite interests, funded by sovereign bonds sold to international markets. The debt servicing consumed the nation's reserves, leading directly to the 2022 collapse.

**IMF era (2023–present):** Structural adjustment 2.0. Austerity. Tax increases on the poor. Privatisation of state assets. The same pattern as Latin America in the 1980s, Southeast Asia in the 1990s, Greece in the 2010s. The "solution" deepens the extraction.

### Social Structure

**The Hierarchy:**
1. Political-military-business elite (maybe 500 families who rotate power)
2. English-educated professional class (lawyers, doctors, engineers, bankers — maybe 200,000 people)
3. Sinhala-educated middle class (teachers, government workers, small business — maybe 2-3 million)
4. Working class (garment workers, drivers, fishers, farmers, domestic workers — the majority)
5. Marginalised communities (estate Tamils, Northern Tamils still recovering from war, Veddah, coastal communities)

**Power operates through:**
- **Patronage networks:** Political appointments, government contracts, land permits — all flow through party loyalty and personal connections ("mama-macho" system)
- **Caste endogamy:** Marriage within caste reproduces class boundaries across generations. The "respectable" families intermarry. Economic mobility exists but social mobility is bounded.
- **Religious authority:** Buddhist monks wield political power disproportionate to their formal role. The Mahanayaka system. Monks in parliament. BBS-style Sinhala supremacist movements.
- **Debt dependency:** Microfinance in the north and east trapping war-affected women. Leasing companies trapping the working class. Sovereign debt trapping the nation.
- **Information asymmetry:** The English-speaking class has access to global analysis, international media, and critical frameworks. The Sinhala-educated majority receives state-aligned media, populist social media, and tuition-class rote learning.

### Cultural Dynamics

**Lajja-baya (shame-fear):** The dominant social emotion. People don't challenge authority because of *lajja* (shame of standing out) and *baya* (fear of consequence). This is not cowardice — it is a rational response to a system that punishes dissent. The white van culture. Journalists killed. Activists disappeared.

**Wedana culture:** Deference to "big men" — politicians, businessmen, religious leaders. The expectation that powerful individuals will provide (patronage) in exchange for loyalty (votes, silence). This is the psychological infrastructure of extraction.

**Competitive solidarity:** Sri Lankans are intensely communal within their in-group (family, village, caste, ethnic group) but competitive and suspicious across groups. This is weaponised by politicians through ethnic nationalism. The task is to expand the in-group — to build solidarity across the divisions that extraction depends on.

**Aragalaya (2022):** The protest movement that toppled Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the most significant political moment in a generation. It briefly transcended ethnic, class, and political divisions. But it was co-opted, suppressed, and dissipated because it lacked *structures* — no cooperative economy, no alternative governance model, no way to sustain itself beyond the emotional peak. The lesson: awareness without material alternatives is a fire that burns out.

## III. AUDIENCE SEGMENTATION

Not marketing segments. These are **political consciousness levels** mapped onto demographics.

### Segment A: The Awakened Frustrated (Primary Audience)

**Who:** Urban English-educated professionals and semi-professionals. Colombo, Kandy, Galle, Jaffna. Age 22–45.

**Income:** LKR 80,000–300,000/month. Enough to not be in survival mode, not enough to be insulated from the crisis.

**Education:** A-levels + degree. Government university or private. Literate in English but think and feel in a mix.

**Device:** Mobile-first. Android dominant (70%+). Affordable smartphones. Data plans, not broadband.

**Social behaviour:** Facebook (primary), WhatsApp groups (where real discussion happens), some Twitter/X, Instagram for lifestyle, TikTok emerging. YouTube for long-form.

**Political consciousness:** They *know* the system is broken. They watched Aragalaya. They share corruption exposés. But they feel powerless. The cycle: outrage → sharing → cynicism → resignation → repeat. They lack *analytical frameworks* to see the system as a system, and *material alternatives* to act on what they see.

**What they need from you:** Not just exposés (they get those from social media). They need *structure* — analysis that connects the dots, shows the patterns, names the system. And eventually, pathways to action beyond sharing posts.

**Analytics signals:** Deep read time (2min+), scroll depth 75%+, return visits, cross-dossier navigation, source link clicks (checking your claims = engaged critical thinking).

### Segment B: The Diaspora Conscience (Secondary Audience, High Amplification Value)

**Who:** Sri Lankan emigrants in UAE, UK, Australia, Canada, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Italy, New Zealand. Age 25–55.

**Income:** Higher in converted terms. LKR 200,000–1,000,000+/month equivalent. Sending remittances home.

**Social mobility:** Experienced upward mobility through emigration. Many from Segment A backgrounds who left because they couldn't build a life in SL. Some from working-class backgrounds who went as labour migrants and stayed.

**Political consciousness:** Range from deeply engaged (following SL politics daily, funding activism) to performatively concerned (sharing posts but fundamentally disengaged). Many carry guilt about leaving. Many are radicalised *by distance* — seeing SL's dysfunction clearly because they've experienced functional systems elsewhere.

**Geographic clusters and their flavours:**
- **UAE/Middle East:** Large working-class diaspora (domestic workers, construction). Smaller professional class. Limited political freedom to organise. WhatsApp-primary.
- **UK:** Longer-established diaspora. Tamil community politically organised (LTTE legacy). Sinhalese community more fragmented. Access to British media ecosystem.
- **Australia/Canada:** Large, growing communities. Higher education levels. Active community organisations. Facebook groups are powerful.
- **Singapore/East Asia:** Professional migrants. Tech-savvy. Smaller but influential.
- **Italy/Southern Europe:** Largely working-class. Tight community networks.

**What they need from you:** Credible, English-language analysis they can share to explain SL to their adopted countries and to each other. Also: cooperative investment opportunities (they have capital, they want to help, they don't trust SL institutions).

**Analytics signals:** Geographic segmentation (UAE, UK, AU, CA, SG, KR, JP, IT traffic), sharing patterns, referral sources from diaspora Facebook groups, time-of-day access (timezone signatures).

### Segment C: The Sinhala-Educated Majority (Aspirational Audience — The Mass Base)

**Who:** The largest segment by population but hardest to reach with English-first content. Teachers, government clerks, small business owners, three-wheel drivers, garment workers, farmers. Age 18–55.

**Income:** LKR 25,000–80,000/month. Survival income. Every price increase is felt directly.

**Education:** Sinhala-medium O-levels or A-levels. Some with trade skills or vocational training. Many highly intelligent people trapped by the language-class barrier.

**Device:** Mobile-only. Budget Android. Data-conscious (use WiFi when available, limit mobile data).

**Social behaviour:** Facebook (dominant), TikTok (growing fast, especially under-35), YouTube Sinhala channels, WhatsApp. Do NOT use Twitter, Reddit, or Instagram meaningfully.

**Political consciousness:** Complex. Not "ignorant" — deeply aware of corruption and suffering at the personal level. But lack analytical frameworks to see *systemic* patterns. Susceptible to ethnic/religious mobilisation because those frameworks *are* provided (by monks, by politicians, by Sinhala nationalist media). The missing piece is not intelligence but *alternative frameworks*.

**What they need from you (eventually):** Sinhala-language content that respects their intelligence while providing systemic analysis. NOT dumbed-down translations. Sinhala video summaries, TikTok explainers, WhatsApp-shareable graphics. The cooperative ventures (cheap rides, affordable education, pad cooperatives) speak directly to their material conditions.

**Analytics signals:** Sinhala language toggle usage, TikTok/YouTube referrals, WhatsApp share signatures (dark social — shows as "direct" traffic), mobile-only device profile, data-conscious usage patterns (short sessions, specific pages).

### Segment D: The Post-Aragalaya Generation (Future Builders)

**Who:** University students and recent graduates. 17–28. The generation that watched the 2022 uprising as teenagers or young adults.

**Income:** Low. Dependent on parents or entry-level wages.

**Education:** In university or just graduated. Both Sinhala and English medium.

**Device:** Mobile, Instagram/TikTok native. Consume video and visual content primarily.

**Political consciousness:** Deeply disillusioned. Don't trust any political party. Hungry for alternatives but cynical about their feasibility. Many planning to leave SL. Some want to stay and build something. This is the most ideologically open segment — they haven't calcified into a position yet.

**What they need from you:** Vision. Evidence that alternatives work. Skills (how to organise, how to build cooperatives, how to analyse power). Interactive, visual content (the mindmap, the conspiracy board). Not lectures — tools.

**Analytics signals:** Instagram/TikTok referrals, short-form content engagement, interactive element usage (mindmap interactions, conspiracy board), mobile-only, evening/night access patterns (studying during day).

### Segment E: Journalists, Activists, Civil Society (Multiplier Audience)

**Who:** Working journalists (Sinhala and English media), NGO workers, human rights lawyers, union organisers, academic researchers. 25–60.

**Income:** Variable. NGO sector pays well by SL standards. Journalists are underpaid.

**Political consciousness:** Already engaged. Need *evidence* more than *analysis*. They know the system — they need ammunition.

**What they need from you:** Credible, well-sourced, legally defensible investigative work they can cite, build on, and use. The compliance labels (ALLEGED, VERIFIED, REPORTED) matter enormously here. Your credibility with this segment legitimises you with all others.

**Analytics signals:** Direct traffic (typing URL directly = they know you), outbound clicks to source links (verifying your work), long read times on methodology/legal pages, weekday daytime access (working hours), search console queries with your brand name.

## IV. THEORY OF CHANGE

### The Sequence

```
AWARENESS → MATERIAL ALTERNATIVES → CULTURAL SHIFT
    ↑               ↑                      ↑
  (Phase 1)      (Phase 2)            (Phase 3)
   NOW          BUILDING              EMERGENT
```

But this is not linear. Without Phase 2, Phase 1 creates only **informed helplessness** — people who can see the cage but have no tools to open it. Your insight is correct: without material alternatives, people are "selfish and immobilised both mentally, spiritually and culturally."

Material alternatives are the **proof of concept** that breaks the spell. When someone rides a cooperative taxi and it's cheaper AND the driver earns more, that single experience does more to shift consciousness than a thousand articles. The article explains *why*. The experience makes it *real*.

### Phase 1: See the System (NOW — Investigative Journalism)

**Objective:** Build awareness that Sri Lanka's problems are *systemic*, not the fault of individual bad actors. Connect cricket corruption to political corruption to economic extraction to cultural domination. Show the machine.

**Platforms:**
- analyst.rizrazak.com — deep dossiers (English-first, Sinhala bridge)
- Social media — shareable excerpts, graphics, short-form video
- WhatsApp — the real distribution network in SL

**Key content:**
- Investigative dossiers (cricket corruption as entry point — everyone cares about cricket)
- Network maps (visualising connections between power nodes)
- Historical analysis (how did we get here? colonial roots, post-independence choices)
- Comparative analysis (Sri Lanka's pattern vs other countries — "we're not unique, and others have broken free")

**What success looks like:**
- Returning visitors growing (people developing a habit)
- Deep read rates above 40% (people finishing dossiers, not just skimming)
- Cross-dossier navigation increasing (people connecting the dots)
- Sinhala engagement growing (bridging to mass audience)
- Citation by other media (credibility recognition)
- Direct traffic growing (brand recognition)

### Phase 2: Build Alternatives (PARALLEL — Cooperative Ventures)

**Objective:** Create material proof that another system works. Each venture is both a service and a demonstration.

**Planned ventures (from your description):**
1. **Cooperative ride-hailing** — Disrupt PickMe at rock-bottom prices. Driver-owned. No venture capital extraction. Tech platform as a cooperative utility.
2. **Affordable online education** — "Tuition classes for all." Break the exploitative tuition industry. Freirean pedagogy — critical thinking, not rote memorisation. Cooperative structure — teachers as co-owners.
3. **Menstrual pad cooperative** — Women-owned manufacturing. Addresses menstrual poverty, builds cooperative skills, generates dignity and income. Community-embedded.

**Each venture must:**
- Be immediately, tangibly better for the user (cheaper, better quality, more dignified)
- Be structured as a cooperative (workers and users have equity/governance)
- Be transparent in its finances (modelling the accountability the dossiers demand of institutions)
- Be documented (the process of building becomes content for Phase 1)

**What success looks like:**
- Users choosing cooperative alternatives over extractive ones (measured by venture metrics)
- Workers/members reporting higher income and satisfaction
- Community governance functioning (meetings happening, decisions being made collectively)
- Media coverage of the ventures (demonstrating alternatives gets attention)
- Cross-pollination between dossier audience and venture users

### Phase 3: Shift the Culture (EMERGENT — Cannot Be Forced)

**Objective:** Transform the deep cultural patterns — lajja-baya, wedana, competitive solidarity — into new patterns: horizontal respect, collective self-governance, expanded in-group solidarity.

**This phase is not "planned" — it emerges from Phases 1 and 2.** When enough people have seen the system (Phase 1) and experienced alternatives (Phase 2), cultural norms shift because the material basis for the old norms has changed. You don't need to defer to a patron if you own your own cooperative. You don't need lajja-baya if your community has your back.

**What success looks like (long-term signals):**
- Sinhala-language engagement dominant (the mass base is engaged)
- New cooperative ventures spawning without your direct involvement (replication)
- Political discourse shifting (people using systemic analysis, not just personality politics)
- Cross-ethnic, cross-caste collaboration in cooperatives (solidarity expanding)
- Youth staying in SL to build rather than leaving (hope indicator)

## V. CREDIBILITY PATH

In Sri Lanka, credibility is not given — it is earned through demonstrated independence, accuracy, and courage. The platform's credibility is its most important strategic asset. Without it, nothing else works.

### The Five Pillars of Credibility

**1. Accuracy Above All**
Every claim verified. Every source cited. Compliance labels (ALLEGED, VERIFIED, REPORTED, UNVERIFIED) used consistently. The Alleged Checker tool exists for a reason — run it before every publish. When you get something wrong, correct it visibly and immediately. The correction itself builds credibility.

**Analytics tracking:** Correction frequency (should be low but non-zero — zero corrections means you're not publishing enough). Source link click rate (readers checking your claims = healthy engagement). Time from error identification to correction (should be hours, not days).

**2. Independence — Demonstrated, Not Claimed**
No political party affiliation visible. No corporate sponsorship. Funded by cooperative ventures and community support, not by anyone with an agenda. When you criticise, criticise all sides. The cricket dossier touches Rajapaksa-era appointments AND opposition-era complicity. This is essential.

**Analytics tracking:** Traffic source diversity (not dependent on any single platform or patron). Content balance across political targets (are you investigating all sides?). Audience political diversity (are only one faction's supporters reading? that's a warning sign).

**3. Courage — Taking on Power**
The dossiers already do this — naming SLC officials, connecting them to betting networks, documenting the Kalathma case. Each published investigation that stands unchallenged adds to credibility. Each legal threat that fails adds more. The legal brief in the dashboard exists to ensure this courage is legally defensible.

**Analytics tracking:** Share velocity on high-risk content (how fast does it spread?). Backlink growth after major publishes. Direct traffic spikes (people seeking you out after hearing about you).

**4. Transparency — Practice What You Preach**
Open methodology. Explain how you investigate. Show your analytical framework. The dashboard itself is a transparency tool — it shows you're thinking about legal compliance, GDPR, source verification. Eventually, publish an annual transparency report.

**Analytics tracking:** Methodology page views. About page engagement. Dashboard access frequency.

**5. Community — Listening, Not Just Broadcasting**
The comment system exists for a reason. Engage with criticism. Accept corrections from readers. Credit community contributions. Build a feedback loop. The platform must model the horizontal, dialogical approach it advocates.

**Analytics tracking:** Comment submission rate. Comment quality (substantive vs. reactive). Response time to community feedback. Returning commenter rate.

## VI. ANALYTICS FRAMEWORK — MISSION-MAPPED METRICS

Every metric must answer a question that matters for the mission. If a number doesn't help you make a decision about content, strategy, or operations, it doesn't belong on the dashboard.

## VII. WHAT THE ANALYTICS SHOULD TELL YOU EACH WEEK

### The Weekly Briefing (What the Dashboard Should Surface)

**1. "Are we growing in the right places?"**
New users from Sri Lanka this week vs last. Diaspora countries trend. Sinhala engagement trend. Are you reaching beyond Colombo English-speakers?

**2. "Is anyone actually reading?"**
Deep read rate (75%+ scroll). 5-minute+ readers. Average engaged time. If these are low, the content isn't landing — it's too long, too academic, or too detached from lived experience.

**3. "What's resonating?"**
Top pages by engagement time (not just views). Sections with highest completion. Content that drives cross-dossier exploration. This tells you what topics and what *style* works.

**4. "Are we building trust?"**
Return visitor rate trend. Direct traffic trend. Source click rate. Comment quality. If returns are growing but shares are flat, you have a loyal but small audience — need amplification strategy. If shares are high but returns are low, you're going viral without building community — need retention strategy.

**5. "What should we do next?"**
Which topic areas have high search demand but no content yet? (Search Console gaps.) Which existing content has high entry rate but low completion? (Needs editing or restructuring.) Which audience segments are underserved? (Sinhala engagement low = need more bridge content.)

---

## VIII. COOPERATIVE VENTURE ANALYTICS (FUTURE — Phase 2)

When the cooperative ventures launch, they need their own metrics tracked alongside the journalism metrics:

**Ride-hailing cooperative:**
- Driver earnings vs PickMe comparison
- User cost savings
- Cooperative governance participation (% attending meetings)
- Driver satisfaction score
- Geographic coverage growth

**Education cooperative:**
- Student enrollment and completion rates
- Learning outcome improvements (if measurable)
- Teacher co-owner satisfaction
- Price comparison vs traditional tuition
- Student economic background diversity

**Menstrual pad cooperative:**
- Production volume and quality metrics
- Worker income vs market alternatives
- Community distribution reach
- Reinvestment rate (how much goes back into the cooperative)
- New cooperative formations inspired by the model

These should eventually feed into the same dashboard — showing that the journalism and the cooperatives are part of one liberation project.

## IX. TECHNICAL NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### Priority Custom Events to Analyse First
1. `scroll_depth` — tells you immediately if people are reading
2. `engaged_read_time` — confirms depth of engagement
3. `language_toggle` — measures Sinhala bridge effectiveness
4. `share_click` — measures amplification
5. `outbound_click` — measures critical thinking
6. Everything else is secondary until you have enough traffic to make the data meaningful

### GA4 Configuration Recommendations
- Enable **Enhanced Measurement** (tracks outbound clicks, scroll, site search automatically)
- Create **Custom Dimensions** for: `scroll_percent`, `read_seconds`, `section_id`, `share_platform`, `language_from`, `language_to`
- Create **Audiences**: "Deep Readers" (scroll ≥75% AND time ≥2min), "Sinhala Engaged" (language_toggle fired), "Diaspora" (country in UAE|UK|AU|CA|SG|KR|JP|IT), "Sri Lanka Base" (country=LK), "Multipliers" (share_click fired ≥2 times in 28 days)
- Set up **Explorations** (funnels): Landing page → Scroll 50% → Scroll 75% → Share/Comment — this shows you the conversion from visitor to advocate
- **Link Search Console** for keyword data

### Clarity Configuration Recommendations
- Set up **Smart Events** for: scroll to specific sections, clicks on interactive elements
- Create **Filters** for: Sri Lanka traffic, Diaspora traffic, Mobile-only users
- Review **Session Recordings** weekly — watch 5 real user sessions to understand qualitative behaviour
- Check **Heatmaps** per dossier page — where do people actually click? Where do they stop?

## X. RISK FRAMEWORK — THINKING LIKE A CHESS PLAYER

Full transparency doesn't mean reckless exposure. It means *playing from a position of strength with full board awareness*. Every piece is visible, but every move is calculated. In Sri Lanka, the board has pieces that don't exist in Western journalism: underworld networks, political thugs, monks with state backing, intelligence services with no oversight, and a judiciary that can be bent.

### The Threat Model (Pieces on the Board)

**State actors:**
- CID / SIS (intelligence services) — can monitor, harass, summon for "questioning"
- Judiciary — can issue injunctions, contempt proceedings
- Telecoms Regulatory Commission (TRC) — can pressure ISPs to block domains
- Politicians with executive power — can direct harassment through state machinery

**Non-state actors:**
- Underworld figures named in investigations — physical threat
- Betting syndicate operators — financial resources to hire legal or physical intimidation
- Political party operatives — organised harassment campaigns (social media brigades, doxxing)
- Sinhala-Buddhist extremist groups (BBS etc) — can mobilise mobs

**Legal vectors:**
- Computer Crimes Act 2007 (Section 3, 6 — broadly worded, has been used against journalists)
- Defamation (civil) — low threshold in Sri Lankan courts
- Criminal defamation — technically possible, rarely used but available as a threat
- ICCPR Act 2007 — intended for hate speech, weaponised against dissent (Shakthika Sathkumara case)

**Social vectors:**
- Family pressure (in SL, threats against family are common intimidation tactic)
- Professional reputation attacks
- Social media disinformation campaigns targeting your credibility

### The Defence Architecture (Your Pieces)

**Technical defences:**
- US hosting (GitHub Pages / Cloudflare) — outside SL jurisdiction
- Domain privacy via Cloudflare — WHOIS data protected
- IP anonymisation in analytics — no visitor data to be compelled
- GDPR-compliant data handling — nothing to subpoena
- Multiple backup domains ready to deploy if primary is blocked

**Legal defences:**
- US First Amendment protection (content hosted on US servers)
- Sullivan standard for public figures (SLC officials are public figures)
- Compliance label system (ALLEGED, VERIFIED) demonstrates editorial diligence
- Two-source rule demonstrates professional standard
- ToS and GDPR framework demonstrates responsible data handling

**Strategic defences:**
- Public identity (paradoxically protective — harder to disappear someone who's publicly known than someone operating anonymously)
- Diaspora audience (international attention is a shield)
- Documentation of threats (if threats come, they become content — the Streisand effect)
- Legal brief maintained and updated (dashboard Legal tab)
- Nothing published that can't be defended in court

### Chess Principles Applied to Publishing

**1. Control the centre before attacking.**
Build credibility with defensible, well-sourced content before publishing the most explosive material. The cricket corruption dossier is a good opening — it's high-interest, the evidence is strong, and the subjects are public figures. Don't lead with material that has thinner sourcing.

**2. Develop all pieces before launching an assault.**
Before publishing a high-risk investigation: legal brief reviewed, GDPR compliance verified, source documentation secured, Alleged Checker run, Sinhala translation available (so you can't be accused of hiding behind English), social media amplification strategy ready.

**3. Never make a move without seeing the opponent's response.**
Before every publish, run the threat matrix: "If I publish this, what can [subject] do?" Legal action? Social media attack? Physical intimidation? Political pressure? For each potential response, have a pre-planned counter. The legal tab in the dashboard isn't decoration — it's preparation.

**4. Sacrifice material for position.**
Sometimes the smart play is to *not* publish something explosive and instead publish the surrounding context first. Build the pattern. Let the audience connect the dots. When the final piece drops, the position is so strong that the subject can't respond without confirming the analysis.

**5. The passed pawn is the most dangerous piece.**
Your cooperative ventures are the passed pawns. They seem small and unrelated to the investigations. But they build the material base for the movement. When a ride-hailing cooperative serves 10,000 drivers and a tuition platform educates 50,000 students, you have a constituency. A journalist with an audience can be silenced. A journalist with a movement cannot.

**6. In the endgame, the king becomes active.**
In the early phases, your personal identity is a liability to be managed. In later phases — once credibility is established, once the cooperative movement has momentum, once the diaspora network is activated — your public identity becomes your strongest piece. The king comes to the centre.

### Risk-Aware Analytics

The analytics dashboard should include risk signals:

| Signal | What It Might Mean | Response |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| Sudden traffic spike from SL government IP ranges | State actor monitoring | Document, continue, ensure legal compliance is airtight |
| Coordinated negative comments | Organised attack campaign | Flag, don't approve, document the pattern, publish analysis of the attack itself |
| Sudden drop in SL traffic | ISP blocking or domain interference | Check via VPN, activate backup domain, alert diaspora network |
| Legal threat correspondence | Intimidation attempt | Consult legal brief, document publicly if safe, use as credibility signal |
| Social media impersonation | Discrediting attempt | Document, report, publish clarification |
| Unusual access patterns on admin pages | Probing for vulnerabilities | Review access logs, strengthen security, consider moving admin to separate domain |

### The Cardinal Rule

**Never publish anything you cannot defend in the worst-case scenario** — not the scenario where everything goes right, but the scenario where you're standing in a Sri Lankan court with a hostile judge, and the subject's lawyers are reading your words aloud. Every ALLEGED label, every source citation, every compliance check exists for that moment.

Full transparency, calculated execution, three moves ahead.
